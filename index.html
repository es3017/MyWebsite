        <p>My name is Ethan Smith. I love to play the drums, go on hikes, paint, and listen to music. I am a drummer in two local bands in Bloomington Indiana and love to perform in front of people. I graduate in December with a bachelors in science and engineering focussing on Computer Graphics Technology!</p>
